Further clues and investigation lead the crew to the Pantheon, where they uncover Leonardo\'s secret workshop filled with all his inventions. Animatronio suddenly reappears, having faked his death, and tries to kill the crew to keep the discovery a secret, but unwittingly reveals that all of Leonardo\'s inventions assemble to form a spacecraft. Fry and Farnsworth enter the craft and are taken to Vinci, a planet inhabited by humanoid intellectuals including Leonardo himself, who came to Earth as a means to escape being bullied as the stupidest among his peers, but became infuriated by how much more stupid its inhabitants were. Leonardo uses his missing drawing to build a giant machine designed to kill his tormentors, but Fry sabotages it before it can do so. As a last resort, Leonardo pulls a lever on the machine which drops a giant cog on him and crushes him to death. Fry and Farnsworth then take the spacecraft back to Earth.',

With the help of Hermes, Bender decides to confront his inspector from when he was first manufactured, known to him only as Inspector 5. All information on Inspector 5 turns up missing at the Central Bureaucracy where he worked, so Bender calls Mom\'s Friendly Robot Company to report his fatal defect. Not wanting a flawed robot to roam around in public, Mom sends killbots after Bender. Bender\'s and Hermes\' escape takes them to Tijuana, Mexico, where Bender was manufactured. Bender goes to Inspector 5\'s home to find once again that he is not there, and is forced to accept his own mortality. The killbots continue to try and kill Bender until Hermes fakes his death by accessing Inspector 5\'s database and labels Bender as "terminated", ending the pursuit. Bender returns home with Hermes with newfound pride in his mortality, oblivious as Hermes pulls out Inspector 5\'s missing profile and burns it, revealing himself as Inspector 5. A series of flashbacks then show how Hermes overrode the baby Bender\'s defect and quit his job because he could not bring himself to dispose of him, and how he kept all information on his identity a secret during the search with Bender.',

Unfortunately, Farnsworth accidentally sets the machine to send them into the year 10,000 AD, and the card is lost in the time vortex outside. Because their time machine can only travel into the future, Fry, Bender, and Farnsworth continue traveling through time until a backwards time machine is invented. Meanwhile, Leela assumes Fry stood her up again to go a robot strip club which is reported to have been destroyed in an accident, leading her to believe he is dead until she reads his card, which reappears in the year 3050. Realizing Fry did not mean to stand her up, Leela goes back to Cavern on the Green and leaves a message in stalagmites for Fry to find, reading how she cherished their time together. Fry finds the message in the year One Billion, when all life is extinct. With no hope of finding another time machine, Fry, Bender, and Farnsworth watch the end of the universe together, which leads to a second Big Bang after which all time repeats itself. The time machine returns to the point in time before it first left, crushing the new universe\'s Fry, Bender, and Farnsworth beneath it in the process and allowing Fry to reach his date with Leela on time.',

In mere hours, the nanobots evolve into robotic trilobites and devour the Planet Express ship. While trying to survive over the next few days, the crew witnesses the trilobites evolve into mechanical dinosaurs, which are wiped out by a solar flare and allow robotic mammals to evolve into modern-day humanoids. The crew is discovered by a robot naturalist who brings the discovery of intelligent, carbon-based life forms to the attention of the robot society, but Farnsworth is put on trial when he reveals the creationist-like fact that he is the source of their society. By the time the court reaches a verdict the next day, the robots have evolved into energy-based life forms and abandon the issue altogether, deeming it beneath them.
